The best programmers are not marginally better than merely good ones. They are an order-of-magnitude better, measured by whatever standard: conceptual creativity, speed, ingenuity of design, or problem-solving ability. (Randall E. Stross) First learn computer science and all the theory. Next develop a programming style. Then forget all that and just hack. (George Carrette) Complexity kills. It sucks the life out of developers, it makes products difficult to plan, build and test, it introduces security challenges, and it causes end-user and administrator frustration. (Ray Ozzie) A good programmer is someone who always looks both ways before crossing a one-way street. (Doug Linder) The best method for accelerating a computer is the one that boosts it by 9.8 m/s2.

You canâ€™t have great software without a great team, and most software teams behave like dysfunctional families. (Jim McCarthy) It has been said that the great scientific disciplines are examples of giants standing on the shoulders of other giants. It has also been said that the software industry is an example of midgets standing on the toes of other midgets. (Alan Cooper) First learn computer science and all the theory. Next develop a programming style. Then forget all that and just hack. (George Carrette) But what is it good for?
