The best programmers are not marginally better than merely good ones. They are an order-of-magnitude better, measured by whatever standard: conceptual creativity, speed, ingenuity of design, or problem-solving ability. (Randall E. Stross) First learn computer science and all the theory. Next develop a programming style. Then forget all that and just hack. (George Carrette) Complexity kills. It sucks the life out of developers, it makes products difficult to plan, build and test, it introduces security challenges, and it causes end-user and administrator frustration. (Ray Ozzie) A good programmer is someone who always looks both ways before crossing a one-way street. (Doug Linder) The best method for accelerating a computer is the one that boosts it by 9.8 m/s2.
